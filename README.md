# Reporting Standards and Best Practices
The reporting best practices are designed to standardize the sharing of resources across state lines. By following the best practices for documentation, user acceptance testing (UAT), and architecture, contributors can leverage existing tools and reduce redundant work. These standards ensure that resources added to the exchange come with clear documentation, allowing other organizations to efficiently integrate dashboards, reports, and other assets into their systems.

Documentation Best Practices: Detailed guidelines for the required documentation when adding resources to the exchange, ensuring clarity and usability.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Best Practices: A comprehensive framework guiding organizations through testing their contributed resources, ensuring quality and consistency.

UAT Templates: Sample and blank templates to streamline the UAT process, helping contributors efficiently test resources before submission.

Best Practices Checklist: A step-by-step checklist ensuring contributors follow necessary procedures and comply with the reporting standards developed by states.
