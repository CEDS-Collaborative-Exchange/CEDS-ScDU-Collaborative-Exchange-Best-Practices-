# CEDS-ScDU-Collaborative-Exchange-Best-Practices-
**Overview**

The Scalable Data Use (ScDU) working group was established in May 2024 as a collaborative effort across state lines. The purpose of this group was to determine best practices for sharing resources through the CEDS open-source collaborative exchange. Our aim was to standardize resource-sharing across organizations, allowing contributors to leverage existing tools and reduce redundant work.

**Purpose**

The ScDU group created comprehensive guidelines and best practices for organizations contributing to the collaborative exchange. These best practices ensured that resources added to the exchange would be accompanied by thorough documentation, enabling other organizations to quickly and efficiently integrate dashboards, reports, and other assets into their systems.

**Contributions**

The ScDU group developed the following:

**Documentation Best Practices**: A detailed set of guidelines outlining the documentation organizations should provide when adding resources to the exchange.

**User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Best Practices**: A framework to guide organizations through testing the resources they contribute, ensuring quality and consistency.

**UAT Templates**: Both sample and blank templates for UAT processes, allowing organizations to streamline their testing efforts before submitting resources to the exchange.

**ScDU Best Practices Checklist**: A checklist designed to assist contributors in following all necessary steps and guidelines, ensuring compliance with the reporting standards developed by states. 

**Impact**

By adhering to the best practices established in this repository, organizations are able to standardize the sharing of resources, allowing organizations to efficiently download and integrate dashboards and reports into their own systems without duplicating efforts.
